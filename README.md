# Dynamic Content and Tailwind CSS in Next.js/Nuxt.js

This repository demonstrates a common issue when using Tailwind CSS with Next.js or Nuxt.js: dynamically generated content not inheriting Tailwind CSS classes.  The problem is due to the way Tailwind CSS is integrated, particularly concerning server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side updates.

## Problem

When content is added to the DOM after the initial render (e.g., through JavaScript), Tailwind's styles might not be applied correctly.  This is because the initial CSS generated during SSR only covers the content rendered on the server.  Subsequent client-side updates don't automatically pick up the existing Tailwind styles.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that Tailwind styles are re-applied to the dynamically generated content. This can often be achieved by using a technique to force a re-render of the component containing the dynamic elements.
